                    I learned were current, if not more so, in the company
                    i joined. I honestly feel i got every penny's worth.

                    I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                    people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for free 
                    intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter
                    The next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life.
                    Since completing the course. I'v successfully switched careers, working as a 
                    software Engineer at a VR startup

                        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who
                        can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappooint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile  team project, in particular, was outstanding.
                        It took my learning to another level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience.
                        It certainly helped me land a job as a full-sytack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
